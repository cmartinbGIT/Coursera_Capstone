It is rainy and windy, and on the way, you come across a terrible traffic jam on the other side of the highway. Long lines of cars barely moving. As you keep driving, police car start appearing from afar shutting down the highway.\nOh, it is an accident and there's a helicopter transporting the ones involved in the crash to the nearest hospital.\nThey must be in critical condition for all of this to be happening. Now, wouldn't it be great if there is something in place that could warn you, given the weather and the road conditions about the possibility of you getting into a car accident and how severe it would be, so that you would drive more carefully or even change your travel if you are able to. </p>\n<p>\nYou can find the Example Dataset by <a href=\"https://s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/cf-courses-data/CognitiveClass/DP0701EN/version-2/Data-Collisions.csv\"> Clicking here</a>.
